# Random decision forest

Tired of your long days spent debugging in production, you've decided to head off to new horizons. It's time for a family vacation! After crossing mountains and valleys, you arrive at a gloomy forest where the holiday cottage you've booked must be. Even the name on the map is frightening: the random decision forest.

You all agree that the grown-ups will go scouting: the minimum age for venturing into this sinister forest will be 15. The others will wait in the car with coding exercises.

Given the ages of the 5 family members, how many people will explore the forest?

## Input

**Lines 1 to 5**: One integer per line, the age of a family member, from 1 to 100.

## Output

The number of people aged 15 or over.

The 21, 15 and 24 year-olds are over 15, making 3 people.
